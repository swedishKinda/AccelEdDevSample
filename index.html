                        Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and beliefs that can be seen among
                        Americans
                        collectively, there are thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which citizens
                        can
                        belong. The terms group and organization are very loose and can be interpreted very broadly.
                        Some
                        groups are very general and open to all without question while others may have specific goals or
                        very
                        selective membership. They can be economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue
                        organizations. However, we can break them down into political organizations, interest groups,
                        voluntary
                        and civic associations, unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.

                            <p>Political organizations have the general goal of trying to either influence or take
                                control
                                of
                                government to achieve outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats, Republicans,
                                and
                                Libertarians, all fall in the category, but one might also find groups such as
                                FreedomWorks
                                or the Center
                                for American Progress. Depending on the group or organization, citizens may find
                                membership
                                in them a
                                challenge as political parties often take time to join in an active level, or groups may
                                insist on alignment
                                with philosophical goals.</p>

                            <p> Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or idea. These groups run the table

                                terms

                                influence leadership. However, membership tends to be less restrictive as many look for
                                volunteers to
                                help spread their messages and ideas.</p>

                                a means of fraternal support. Such groups differ widely, with some very open to anyone

                                as the Red Cross or United Way, and others with very selective membership procedures,

                            <p> Unions were created to support the needs of workers in various fields of industry and
                                service and
                                are responsible for helping to promote safe workplaces and fair labor practices. Over

                                years, unions
                                have often increased their activities to include charitable works and political
                                involvement
                                to support
                                candidates and ideas that serve to aid their general membership. Unions include the

                                and the
                                NEA. Union membership is selective in that one must usually be employed in a particular
                                field to join;
                                however, in some places union membership is actually mandatory by state law if employed

                            <p> Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to specific religious
                                denominations or sects,
                                or it can refer to organizations and societies that support the views of particular
                                religions and belief
                                systems. For example, entire denominations have lobbying organizations to petition on
                                their
                                behalf.
                                Other organizations exist to promote the ideas of a religious group, such as the
                                Anti-Defamation League,
                                which exists to prevent persecution of Jewish citizens, and the Knights of Columbus, an
                                association of
                                Catholic men. Generally, membership in groups requires adherence to the beliefs of the
                                sect
                                or
                                denomination, but some have more stringent requirements for participation.
