                Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and beliefs that can be seen among Americans
                collectively, there are thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which citizens can
                belong. The terms group and organization are very loose and can be interpreted very broadly. Some
                groups are very general and open to all without question while others may have specific goals or very
                selective membership. They can be economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue
                organizations. However, we can break them down into political organizations, interest groups, voluntary
                and civic associations, unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.

                        <p>Political organizations have the general goal of trying to either influence or take control
                            of
                            government to achieve outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats, Republicans, and
                            Libertarians, all fall in the category, but one might also find groups such as FreedomWorks
                            or the Center
                            for American Progress. Depending on the group or organization, citizens may find membership
                            in them a
                            challenge as political parties often take time to join in an active level, or groups may
                            insist on alignment
                            with philosophical goals.</p>

                        <p> Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or idea. These groups run the table in
                            terms
                            of interests and concerns, including the National Organization for Women, La Raza, National
                            Right to
                            Life, and the National Rifle Association. Many could be considered political as they have
                            aims to
                            influence leadership. However, membership tends to be less restrictive as many look for
                            volunteers to
                            help spread their messages and ideas.</p>

                        <p>Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most local level of group membership.
                            Often
                            parts of larger organizations, these groups are often charitable, and work for general
                            causes, or serve as
                            a means of fraternal support. Such groups differ widely, with some very open to anyone
                            interested, such
                            as the Red Cross or United Way, and others with very selective membership procedures, such
                            as the Elks
                            or Freemasons.</p>

                        <h5>Unions</h5>
                        <img
                            src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/strike-700-members-stock-handlers-600w-237229153.jpg">
                        <p> Unions were created to support the needs of workers in various fields of industry and
                            service and
                            are responsible for helping to promote safe workplaces and fair labor practices. Over the
                            years, unions
                            have often increased their activities to include charitable works and political involvement
                            to support
                            candidates and ideas that serve to aid their general membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO
                            and the
                            NEA. Union membership is selective in that one must usually be employed in a particular
                            field to join;
                            however, in some places union membership is actually mandatory by state law if employed in
                            certain
                            jobs.</p>

                        <h5>Religious Groups</h5>
                        <img
                            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/George_W._Bush_meeting_Knights_of_Columbus_in_Dallas%2C_Texas.jpg">
                        <p> Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to specific religious
                            denominations or sects,
                            or it can refer to organizations and societies that support the views of particular
                            religions and belief
                            systems. For example, entire denominations have lobbying organizations to petition on their
                            behalf.
                            Other organizations exist to promote the ideas of a religious group, such as the
                            Anti-Defamation League,
                            which exists to prevent persecution of Jewish citizens, and the Knights of Columbus, an
                            association of
                            Catholic men. Generally, membership in groups requires adherence to the beliefs of the sect
                            or
                            denomination, but some have more stringent requirements for participation.
