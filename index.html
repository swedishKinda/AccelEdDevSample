            Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and beliefs that can be seen among Americans
            collectively, there are thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which citizens can
            belong. The terms group and organization are very loose and can be interpreted very broadly. Some
            groups are very general and open to all without question while others may have specific goals or very
            selective membership. They can be economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue
            organizations. However, we can break them down into political organizations, interest groups, voluntary
            and civic associations, unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.
